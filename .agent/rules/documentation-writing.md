## Writing documentation

- The main task in this repository is to write and manage documentation.
- Documentation is always in the 'docs' folder.

### Framework

- We use [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to write documentation.
- The documentation is written in markdown and styled with the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.
- We use the monorepo plugin to include the documentation in the main repository.
- Therefore, you are newer allowed to reference a file outside of the docs folder (i.e., do never use the dot-dot syntax like `../some-file.md` to reference a file in the main repository). 
- Always create or locate the file in outside the docs folder and use the available symlinks in docs/ to reference it.

### Documenting with code examples

- Code snippets longer than 5 lines should always be referenced from real code, ideally placed in an 'examples', 'snippets', 'use-cases' or 'getting-started' folder outside the docs folder.
- Code snippets shorter than 5 lines can be inline if necessary
- Make sure paths to snippets are always relative to the file they are included in, but do not reference outside the docs directory (use the symlinks in docs/ to reference files outside of the docs folder).
- Before you create a new file for the snippet, search the whole repository for similar code, maybe it is already in a source file that can be referenced.
- Prefer referencing code from source files over creating new files for snippets.
- Simple commands are allowed and do not count as a code snippet. 
- Do never write code examples inlined in the documentation.
- Always reference code examples using the superfences plugin

```yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - pymdownx.superfences
```

- if you want to include parts of a file in the markdown documentation, you can define a snippet like this (here, the snippet is called 'plugins':

```yaml
# --8<-- [start:plugins]
plugins:
  # Enables search
  - search
  # Allows to add a whole directory in the navigation instead of just files
  # Sub-nav items are automatically created if the provided dir contains subdirectories
  - include_dir_to_nav
# --8<-- [end:plugins]
```

- Then, you can reference it in markdown like this:

```markdown
### Include the entire content of the file

--8<-- "mkdocs_custom.yml"
```

```markdown
### Include only the snippet named 'plugins'

--8<-- "mkdocs_custom.yml:plugins"
```

### Documenting with diagrams

- Use [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) to create diagrams

### Tools

- `make scan_docs`: Runs a script to scan all markdown files for compliance with the rules (no `../` links that go outside of the `docs` folder, no inlined code blocks). Use this to check your work.
