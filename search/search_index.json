Every workflow progresses through a clearly defined set of phases, guarantees data consistency, and handles partial failures gracefully with transactional guarantees like retries, rollbacks, and phase-based error recovery. This design enables users to confidently automate critical processes, knowing that workflows either complete successfully or fail predictably without corrupting system state.</p> <p>Key responsibilities include managing workflow lifecycles, coordinating event-driven executions, efficiently handling resources, and providing detailed execution insights.</p>"},{"location":"neops-workflow-engine-docs/#explore-the-documentation","title":"Explore the documentation","text":"<p>Start by exploring the sections most relevant to your goals.
